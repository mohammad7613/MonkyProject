## Tasks which should be done

### Task with * is really important

 
1* Make guideline about the code obtained in case 5, 6 and 7 in the section of Task which has done 
The thing is that I could not use your codes 
I want you to make a read-me file and introduce your code and the way of using them in clear way such that it can be extended or changed if necessary.

2 Add baseline correction to the codes

3 Add eeg electrode locations to the git with reference to the articles which use them


4 Find important frequency range of EEG for monkey cognition functionality(Attention)

5 calculate Z component
it needs more investigation with Rooyan organization

6 Do all the above step for new file I am going to send you
  

## Tasks which has done

1- Develope ERP calculator and plotter
2- EEG tutorials for EEG lab
3- You are familiar with channel name and their visual location and x,y coordinate
4- Load Raw data to EEGLAB and save them as .set file
5- ERP calculation and Plot them with their variance
6- filtering and EEG preprocessing
7- Develope code for Calculating P30
